The first Arduino board was introduced in 2005 to help design students — who had no previous experience in electronics or microcontroller programming — to create working prototypes connecting the physical world to the digital world. Since then it has become the most popular electronics prototyping tool used by engineers and even large corporations.[^1]

## Electronics Basic Concept

### Ohm's Law

Ohm's law describes the relationship between Voltage ($V$), Current ($I$), and Resistance ($R$). The general equation is:

$$
V=IR
$$

* **Voltage, $V$** is defined as the amount of potential energy in a circuit. (Unit: Volts (V))
* **Current, $I$** is
